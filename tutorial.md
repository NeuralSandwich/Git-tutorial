# Git Basics

## Creating a New Project

To get started using `git` you need to initial a repository. To do this you will
need to run the `git init` command. For the purpose of this tutorial run the
following commands in a bash shell or Git Bash on Windows.

```
mkdir git-tutorial
cd git-tutorial
git init
```

You can also initialize projects using `git init <directory>`. In response to
either of these commands you should see the following output from git

```
Initialized empty Git repository in .git/
```

## Copying Projects

There are many projects with already use git ([github](http://github.com)) to
work on any of these you need to clone the project. You can do this with the
`git clone <url>` command but for now we will move on and come back to this.

## Checking the Status

Now that the repository has been initialized we can check the status of the
working directory and the staging area. Lets check the status now by using
`git status`.

```
On branch master

Initial commit

nothing to commit (create/copy files and use "git add" to track)
```

## Adding Content & Committing

Now that we can get `git` to tell us the status of the repository, lets create
some content for git to keep track of.

```
echo "foo" > foo.txt
echo "bar" > bar.txt
```

Lets check how adding these files change the status of the repository. So again
run `git status`

```
On branch master

Initial commit

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)

    bar.txt
    foo.txt

nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)
```

now run `git add .`

```
On branch master

Initial commit

Changes to be committed:
  (use "git rm --cached <file>..." to unstage)

    new file:   bar.txt
    new file:   foo.txt

```
